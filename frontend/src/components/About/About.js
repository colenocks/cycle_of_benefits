        The <span className='green-text'>Cycle of Benefit</span> Platform
      </h4>
      <p>
        This is a waste management system platform with the aim of eradicating
        the menace on our environment due to improper disposals and management
        of waste, refuse and dumps caused by disregard and nonchalance from
        residents and the government. Most importantly, it serves to incorporate
        a healthy culture, enabling people to have a good sense of their
        environment. The effects of environmental disregard can be seen for
        example in clogged gutters causing flooding, public defecation on the
        streets, streams and rivers leading to various diseases and outbreaks.

        This system actualized by employing a crowd-based immediate and urgent
        approach to tackle these problems and in turn make provisions for the
        participants benefit accordingly, in the hope to make the country as a
        whole to be recognized as a proactive nation- tackling environmental
        challenges and building a healthy, clean and safe environment.

        The platform is populated with environmental sanitation projects by
        hosts (or the government). The projects are tagged with different
        rewards options. A registered user logs into the system and enrols to
        work on one or more of the "Open" projects. When the maximum number of
        workers for a project is reached, the project would be given a status of
        “Assigned”. A time period or limit is attached to each project depending
        on the weight of work to be carried out and upon completion and after
        confirmation from a project verification body, the workers are awarded
        equal number of points based on the total number of reward points the
        projects bears. They can cash out in form of the benefits of their
        choice from the available options.
