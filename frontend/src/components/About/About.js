        This is a waste management system platform with the aim of eradicating
        the menace on our environment due to improper disposals and management
        of waste, refuse and dumps caused by disregard and nonchalance from
        residents and the government. Most importantly, it serves to incorporate
        a healthy culture, enabling people to have a good sense of their
        environment. The effects of environmental disregard can be seen for
        example in clogged gutters causing flooding, public defecation on the
        streets, streams and rivers leading to various diseases and outbreaks.

      <p>
        This system actualized by employing a crowd-based immediate and urgent
        approach to tackle these problems and in turn make provisions for the
        participants benefit accordingly, in the hope to make the country as a
        whole to be recognized as a proactive nation- tackling environmental
        challenges and building a healthy, clean and safe environment.
